# 👋 Hi there, I'm Abhyuday Singh
## About Me
I'm a sophomore at **UC San Diego**, majoring in *Mathematics and Computer Science*, and an aspiring software engineer with a strong drive to build impactful solutions and tackle real-world problems. I enjoy diving deep into new technologies and challenging myself to keep learning every day.
Outside of the classroom and the code editor, I'm a **huge sports fan**. I've been playing **field hockey** and **soccer** since I was a kid, and I still carry that same love for the game today.  
I'm a **Chelsea FC superfan** (Blue is the color! 💙), and I proudly support my local team as a **San Diego FC season ticket holder**. On a more chill day, you'll probably find me enjoying a good game of **chess** or jumping into a round of **trivia** – I'm always down to learn something new.

## 🎧 Currently Listening To
Big fan of **Santan Dave**'s lyricism and **Lil Wayne**'s timeless flow.  
Music keeps me focused while coding and hyped when I'm out and about.

Will add a playlist soon!

## ⚡ Fun fact
I haven't missed a Chelsea game since 2019 – even if it means waking up before sunrise on the West Coast.  
I'm also a vexillophile!
